        Let Me Explain To You How This All Came To Be&hellip;
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">My name is Katie Bani&hellip;</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You probably haven&apos;t heard that name before. That&apos;s because I
        always stayed in the shadows of business.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In 2020, I was working as an operations manager in a consulting firm
        that rapidly scaled from $80,000/mo to $500,000/mo.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Soon after I got promoted to the COO. I consulted businesses to scale at
        7 Figures with systems. And I made multiple 6 figures and pretty much I
        lived and breathed systems.
      </p>

      {/* John's story */}
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-xl font-bold text-white">
        One of my first clients, John, came to us after trying everything&hellip;
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        He had multiple clients to onboard and serve every day. He didn&apos;t
        have experience managing operations at such a scale.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 rounded bg-navy-light/50 p-4 italic text-gold">
        &ldquo;Katie, I was watching a movie with my partner and I got a
        notification on my phone that I needed to onboard a client&hellip; At
        that moment, I hated everything about my business. There has to be a
        better way to run my business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        He gave it his BEST shot&hellip; And it didn&apos;t work. Because he
        played by the rules and he did EVERYTHING he knew to be right&hellip;
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold text-red-accent">
        He Ended Up Stressed Daily And He Hated It&hellip;
      </h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        He hated it because the entire business relied on him. He had goals,
        dreams, and aspirations&hellip; He wanted more out of life&hellip;
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-white">
        Within a few weeks of working together, John&apos;s systems were fully
        streamlined and automated.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The biggest bottleneck was his client onboarding process which cost him
        tens of thousands of dollars in client recurring revenue &amp; countless
        hours in admin work&hellip; This was now fully automated.

        The businesses with the best customer experience thrive, while the

      <p className="mb-4">
        The key difference between the business owners who scale to 7 figures
        and the business &ldquo;owned&rdquo; CEOs, is their ability to use
        leveraged systems to convert clients into lifetime &ldquo;buyers&rdquo;
        that are paying for years.
